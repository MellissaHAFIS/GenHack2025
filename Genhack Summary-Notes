# GenHack 2025 – Project Summary

## 🧠 Project Idea / Subject

### Insights from Charles‑Albert Lehalle (Organizer Talk)

During the meeting, the organizer explained the **core motivation** behind the hackathon challenge:

* ERA5 temperatures are **rescaled/reconstructed** using physical atmospheric models and **infrared data**.
* These reconstructions rely partly on **true temperature observations**, but the final product still contains **systematic errors**.
* Errors tend to be larger in **cities**, **mountain areas**, or **complex terrain** where urban structures or altitude make physical modeling harder.
* To assess the **quality** of ERA5 rescaled temperatures, we must compare them to **ground‑truth station data**.
* To understand how **urbanism** impacts temperature accuracy, we use **NDVI (biomass)** maps from satellite imagery.
* Hypothesis:
  **ERA5 temperature is more accurate in areas with vegetation (high biomass) and less accurate in dense urban zones (low biomass) due to the Urban Heat Island effect.**
* Our mission is to verify this relationship by turning the data into meaningful **plots, metrics, and maps**.

This forms the conceptual foundation for the entire hackathon.
GenHack 2025 is an international hackathon focused on understanding and modeling the **Urban Heat Island (UHI)** effect across Europe using satellite and climate data.

The goal is to:

* Compare **ERA5** rescaled temperature data with **ground‑station observations**.
* Study how **vegetation (NDVI)** affects temperature discrepancies.
* Build visualizations, metrics, and simple explanatory models.
* Provide insights that can help cities better understand and mitigate UHI.

## 📅 Week 1 Thursday, November 13 → Monday, November 17  – What We Have to Do

This week is the **Exploration & Warm‑up phase**.
Focus: explore the provided data sources (ERA5, NDVI, and ground stations).
Our objectives:
- Load and explore all three datasets
- Understand spatial/temporal coverage
- Check data quality and formats
- Identify your study area (choose a city with good ground station coverage)
- Make initial correlations between NDVI, ERA5, and ground stations

### 1. **Load and inspect the datasets**

* Understand the variables, formats, sizes, and spatial/temporal coverage.
* Use the provided notebooks to learn how to open ERA5 NetCDF.

### 2. **Produce first simple visualizations**

* Map ERA5 daily max temperature.
* Map NDVI.
* Plot a few ground‑station temperature series.

### 3. **Perform basic comparisons**

* Pick a small region or sample of stations.
* Compare rescaled ERA5 temperature vs ground truth.
* Look for basic biases (systematic over/under‑estimation).

### 4. **Prepare a small slide deck**

* Objective of the week: show that we understand the data.
* Include 3–5 clean figures.
* Add observations, challenges, and ideas for next weeks.

**Deliverable due: Monday, November 17 at 12:00 (noon).**
