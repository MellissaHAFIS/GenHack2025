# GenHack 2025 – Urban Heat Island Analysis
## Urban Coolers – École Polytechnique Hackathon (Nov–Dec 2025)

This repository contains our work for GenHack 2025, a four-week hackathon focused on analyzing and explaining the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect using:

- ERA5 rescaled temperature data
- Sentinel-2 NDVI (vegetation index)
- Ground-station temperature observations

Our goal is to explore discrepancies between datasets, quantify errors, and propose simple explanatory models for improving local temperature estimates.
